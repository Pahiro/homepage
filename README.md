# homepage
Simple NodeJS homepage that pulls my latest activities from various places

Currently the service calls are done on page load. Considering the unecessary volume of data being returned from some of these services, I'm wondering whether I should have a scheduler pull the data into a db on an hourly basis to improve the page performance.
